# CMOS-Inverter-TSMC-0.25-m-technology

Inverter at TSMC 0.25Î¼m technology using Magic Layout tool and SCN5M_DEEP.12.TSMC. tech27 technology file with Magic.

Adjusted PMOS width so that the inverter high-to-low propagation delay is same as low-to-high propagation delay.



Before adjustment :    PMos width = NMos width.

After adjustment  :    PMos width = 2.5 NMos width.

Plots painted using NGSPICE3.
